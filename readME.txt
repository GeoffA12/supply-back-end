testAPI is the temp name, not really test, treating it like actual API. Definitely v0.0. Getting the hand of it, but
will need clarification on things such has, structure, Demand and Supply DB writing and other resources. IGNORE THE
PYTHON FILE FOR NOW.

Things getting real topsy-turvy around here about APIs, just remember KISS. Keep It Simple Stupid. Potential parameters
added and how they might be utilised for for CURD methods. CURD (Create, Update, Read, Delete) Still ignore python
file.

Updated small things about json objects in API design. Will continue to morph and iterate based on decisions made about
table names and columns
Added vehicle request handling in supplyBE do_POST. Should created a Dispatch() object of the order and responds with
data of the vehicle that was dispatched
webservice do_GET() should be able to handle zero parameter get requests. Just returns the list of vehicles.
Need to update ASCII art of dispatch table on Dispatch.py
